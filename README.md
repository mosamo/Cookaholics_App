#### Mosabeh's Principles for Android Development: (please follow them when commiting code to this repository)

- **DO NOT** Use User-Created Libraries from Github. 
>   Most user-created libraries in Github are Licensed, even if some of them are only attribution licenses, we still can't use them as we have to maintain full autonomy of this project.
- **DO NOT** Use Deprecated Methods or API
> This will only create more problems down the road, and will require you to make different versions of your work for newer devices. 
- **DO NOT** Use Android Libraries that are only exclusive to New Devices
> For this project we are aiming to support more than 98.5% of Devices running Android OS.
- **DO NOT** Use Images from Google in this Project
> You do not have the rights to use them, do not steal other people's work.


- **DO** use Android's inbuilt Image Assets
> They are a source of free scalable Vector images that are supported by all Android Devices
- **DO** use colors from the existing color pallete.
> Try to use colors that are already used across the application to maintain consistency across the application
